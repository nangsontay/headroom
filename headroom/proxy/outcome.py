"""``RequestOutcome``: the canonical value type for "what happened during
one completed proxy request."

Per the P0 audit (``docs/superpowers/specs/P0-proxy-pipeline-audit.md``),
18 ``metrics.record_request`` call sites across four handler files
disagreed on argument shape — 9 of 18 omitted ``cached=``, 7 of 18
omitted ``attempted_input_tokens=``, only 4 sites emitted a structured
PERF log at all. This module is the structural fix: every handler
converges on building a :class:`RequestOutcome` at end-of-request and
hands it to :func:`emit_request_outcome` (also exposed as
:meth:`HeadroomProxy._record_request_outcome`), which owns the four
downstream effects (Prometheus, cost tracker, request logger, PERF
log).

Note: this is **output unification, not input unification**. Provider
APIs (Anthropic ``/v1/messages``, OpenAI Responses WS, Gemini
``generateContent``, Bedrock, Vertex) stay wildly different — the proxy
talks each upstream in its native dialect. This dataclass standardises
only the *observation* about a completed request. Provider-specific
concepts (Anthropic's 5m/1h cache TTL splits, OpenAI's
inferred-write flag, Gemini's read-only cache count) live as optional
fields with neutral defaults; handlers populate what their provider
actually reports.

    A failure outcome (``status_code >= 500``, e.g. a 529 surfaced after retry
    exhaustion) short-circuits before effects 1-4: it records a failed request
    and returns, so an upstream failure cannot feed the success stats.

    Takes the handler as a free argument rather than ``self`` so this
    function is callable from:
    * ``HeadroomProxy._record_request_outcome`` (production)
    * any test dummy that has the three required attributes
      (``metrics``, ``cost_tracker``, optionally ``logger``)
    * any provider handler mixin

    The handler argument is structurally typed (duck-typed); no formal
    Protocol — the requirement is simply that ``handler.metrics`` exists
    and is awaitable-compatible. We could lift this to a typing.Protocol
    if/when another contract surface emerges, but YAGNI.
