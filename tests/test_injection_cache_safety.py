"""Cache-safe CCR proactive-expansion and memory injection gating (#2186).

Both proactive-expansion and memory injection append into an existing user
message (``_append_context_to_latest_non_frozen_user_turn`` on Anthropic, the
``append_text_to_latest_user_chat_message`` sibling on OpenAI). Before this
fix, that append ran unconditionally in token mode:

  (a) ``overlay_cached_prefix`` replays last turn's already-injected bytes
      into the leading positions it proved stable, then the handler appends
      into one of those positions AGAIN -> the segment carries two copies,
      diverges from what the provider hashed, and busts from there on.
  (b) ``execute_expansions`` had no per-session dedup, so the same
      compressed-content hash could be re-injected across requests.
      Selection is an atomic claim (reserve on select, release when the
      append does not happen) — a read-only filter plus a record-after-
      append let two concurrent turns of one session both win the same hash.
  (c) Claude Code's ``/compact`` starts a new session (new conversation-
      scoped session id, phase 2), but the process-wide ``ContextTracker``
      is workspace-scoped only, so old compressed content tracked under the
      pre-compact session could surface right back into the fresh one.
      Ownership is a SET of sessions: ``_contexts`` is keyed by content hash
      alone, so a second session tracking identical content must not
      overwrite the first's ownership.

This covers all three at the unit level: the shared guard
(``injection_target_already_forwarded``) together with the index finders that
tell it WHICH position each provider's append helper will mutate, the
per-session expansion dedup tracker, and ``ContextTracker``'s session-scoped
``analyze_query``.
